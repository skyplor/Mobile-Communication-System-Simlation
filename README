This is a simulation of a mobile communication system.

Three types of events should be handled by the simulator:
- Call initiation [time, speed, station, position, duration]
- Call termination [time, station]
- Call handover [time, speed, station, duration]

States:
- 20 base stations,
- 10 channels each (busy/free)
- Statistics to be collected:
- Handovers
- Dropped calls
- Blocked calls
